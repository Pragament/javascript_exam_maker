## üîß Integration with javascript_exam_maker

This extension is built to work seamlessly with [javascript_exam_maker](https://github.com/your-repo-link).

### üü¢ When user clicks ‚ÄúSelect This Question‚Äù:

```javascript
document.getElementById('start-question-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-recording-event'));
});
````

### üõë When user stops recording from the popup:

The extension fires a callback event:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('recording-stopped-event', () => {
  // Automatically redirect and show prompt
  alert('Recording complete. Redirecting...');
  showAvailableQuestions(); // Custom function defined in your app
});
```

> ‚úÖ `showAvailableQuestions()` is expected to redirect the user and update the interface.
